In this problem, it is defined a recursive relationship in a way that offsprings at the current generation is equal to how many number of rabbits there have been last two generations ago. It can be shown mathematically as follows: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) .
In the first generation, assume there is only one pair of adults. 
Now, it is assumed that for an offspring, it only take one month to become adult and, then to get its own offsprings. 
Here, each generation refers to one month. 
Also, it is supposed that each pair of adults produces only three offsprings at the same time. 
What would be the number of rabbits at the 5th generation? 
Before closing, it's important to note that this problem differs from usual/classical Fibonacci problem. This is based on the assumption that three offsprings are the only options in a litter. Although Fibonnaci suggests 1, here we add new type of variable which is for 3.
