In this problem, it is defined a recursive relationship in a way that offsprings at a generation is equal to how many number of rabbits there have been in the last two generations before today. It can be shown mathematically as follows: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) .
In the first generation, assume there is only one pair of adults. 
Here, each generation refers to one month. 
Also, it is supposed that each pair of adults produces only three offsprings at the same time. 
What would be the number of rabbits at the 5th generation?
